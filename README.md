Final Project - Word-in-Context

Our project aims to be given a word, two sentences using that word, and output whether or not the word has the same meaning in both sentences

1. We have a training and testing dataset with T/F applied for each case
2. We must achieve 70%+ accuracy to get an A
3. We are going to use BERT to process the data
